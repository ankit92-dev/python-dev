Files:- 
The is a file mode, and it tells Python how you want to open the file.
#Syntax:-
file_object = open("filename", "mode", encoding="encoding is optional")

Common File Modes in Python:

"r"	:  Read Only (default): Opens file for reading. File must exist.
"w"	:  Write Only: Opens file for writing. If it exists, it will be overwritten.
"a"	:  Append Only: Opens file for writing at the end. Creates file if it doesn't exist.
"r+":  Read and write. File must exist.
"w+":  Write and read. Overwrites if file exists.
"a+":  Append and read. Creates file if it doesn’t exist.

Summary:-
Mode	Read  Write	File must exist?  Clears existing content?

"r"	    Yes	    No	     Yes	            No
"w"	    No	    Yes	     No	                Yes
"r+"	Yes	    Yes	     Yes	            No
"w+"	Yes	    Yes	     No	                Yes


You can also add b for binary files (like images or audio):

"rb" – read binary
"wb" – write binary
