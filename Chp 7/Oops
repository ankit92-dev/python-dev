Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Python is a paradigm that structures code around objects rather than functions. It models real-world entities using **classes** and **objects**, enabling a more intuitive and scalable way to develop software.

### **How It Works**:-
At its core, OOP in Python revolves around:
- **Classes**: The blueprint defining the attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) of an object.
- **Objects**: Instances of a class that embody the defined attributes and methods.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods within a class while restricting direct access, ensuring data integrity.
- **Inheritance**: Allowing new classes to derive properties from existing ones, promoting code reusability.
- **Polymorphism**: Enabling different classes to define methods with the same name but different implementations, enhancing flexibility.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding unnecessary implementation details and exposing only relevant functionality to the user.

### **Why Use OOP in Python?**
- **Scalability**: Objects encapsulate behaviors, making large programs easier to maintain.
- **Reusability**: Inheritance enables code reuse, reducing redundancy.
- **Modularity**: Code is better structured and easier to debug.
- **Security**: Encapsulation ensures controlled access to data.
- **Real-World Mapping**: Helps model complex systems naturally (e.g., bank accounts, cars, or user profiles).
