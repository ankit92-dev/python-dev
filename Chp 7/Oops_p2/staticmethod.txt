In @staticmethod decorator:(It is a function inside the class, which doesn't/shouldn't contain any attributes of objects)
Example:-
@staticmethod
    def start():
        print("Car started...") #This doesn't contain any attributes, it just use for printing whatever needed.


No self (no instance data)
No cls (no class data)
It's just a regular function placed inside a class for organizational reasons.

Key Point:

A @staticmethod behaves just like a normal function but lives in the class. It cannot access or modify:
Instance attributes (self.attribute)
Class attributes (cls.attribute)

Quick Contrast:

Method Type	    First Parameter	    Can Access Instance (self)	    Can Access Class (cls)

Instance Method	   self	                 Yes	                    Yes (via self._class_)
Class Method	   cls	                 No	                        Yes
Static Method	   None	                 No	                        No
